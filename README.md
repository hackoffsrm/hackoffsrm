## About the project
## Auto illuminated street lights

It has been a while since artificial light has allowed us to see in the dark. We can now light the homes we live in, our workspace and, of course, the streets we wander. This invention has made our lives easier and, as public lighting has become a norm in most parts of the world, safer. Street lighting is now a core piece of urban and rural infrastructure, creating a safe environment for pedestrians and drivers alike.
Street lighting technology and systems advance faster now than ever before and need to always bring more to the table to benefit the people, municipalities, and the planet. 
Our project solves all the problems keeping in sustainable development into account. Auto illuminated street lights would glow automatically when the sunsets. This also has a incredible feature. Taking the dataset of various shops and their timings in a particular municipality and find out which shop closes the last. With that timing and keeping a buffer timing the street lights stop glowing. When a vehichle passes by the street light again glows up.
